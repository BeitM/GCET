# RoboLab FTC Web App

This directory contains the Next.js frontend for RoboLab FTC, an FTC virtual simulation and debugging-feedback prototype.

See the [project README](../../README.md) for the product overview, current features, architecture, limitations, and roadmap.

## Quick Start

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or go directly to [http://localhost:3000/simulator](http://localhost:3000/simulator).

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the development server |
| `pnpm build` | Create and type-check a production build |
| `pnpm start` | Run the production build |
| `pnpm lint` | Run ESLint |

## Prototype Status

The current simulator uses deterministic demo scenarios and mock mentor feedback. It does not yet compile FTC SDK code, run full robot physics, or call a production AI model.
